# Excel: PivotTables in Depth Practice 📈

This repository contains my final practice projects from the **Excel: PivotTables in Depth** course (LinkedIn Learning).

During this course I learned and applied:

- Creating and modifying PivotTables  
- Sorting, filtering, and grouping data  
- Using slicers and timelines for interactivity  
- Calculated fields and items  
- Custom PivotTable styles and visual summaries  

📌 This project represents my continued growth in **Data Analytics**, deepening my understanding of how to summarize, compare, and visualize data effectively using Excel.
